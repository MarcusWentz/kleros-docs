# Notifications

Susie sends notifications about moderation actions and report updates. These notifications can be sent to a notification channel to avoid cluttering the group.

## Enable Notification Channels:

1. Make a channel
2. Add Susie
3. Susie will send a channel ID
4. Use that channel ID to set notifications with /setchannel in the original group

### User Command

`/notifications`: Returns current notification channel

### Admin Command

`/setchannel` : Sets the notification channel

`/setchannelfed` : Sets the federation notification channel
