# Federations

Do you have to ban spammers manually, in all your groups? No more! With federations, Susie can enforce a ban on a user in all federate groups.

Note that currently only the creator of the federation has the ability to add new groups to a federation. Other users can "follow" a federation, meaning bans in the federation are applied locally, but local bans do not result in federation bans.

### User commands

`/fedinfo` Returns current federation

### Admin commands

`/newfed` Creates a federation

`/joinfed` Joins the current group to a Federation
