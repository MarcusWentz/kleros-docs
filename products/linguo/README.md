**Linguo** is an easy-to-use decentralized translation Dapp allowing both translators and translation requesters to interact in a completely trustless manner. It came to light due to our own internal needs for multi-language translation of Kleros content. As it turns out, you can get quality services at a low price when calling on the decentralized free market.You can use this tutorial from [Binance Academy](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-use-metamask) to help you do this.
