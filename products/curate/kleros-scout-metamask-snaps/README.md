# Kleros Scout - Metamask Snaps

Started in 2019 with the Tokens registry, [Kleros](https://kleros.io/?ref=blog.kleros.io) has been a pioneer in curating decentralised registries, especially around security metadata. We now introduce Kleros Scout, a [Metamask Snap](https://metamask.io/snaps/) designed to enable safe contract interactions by providing insights, curated and secured by the community!
