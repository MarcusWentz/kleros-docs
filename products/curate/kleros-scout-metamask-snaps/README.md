# Kleros Scout - Metamask Snaps

Started in 2019 with the Tokens registry, [Kleros](https://kleros.io/?ref=blog.kleros.io) has been a pioneer in curating decentralised registries, especially around security metadata.&#x20;

We now introduce Kleros Scout, a [Metamask Snap](https://metamask.io/snaps/) designed to enable safe contract interactions by providing insights, curated and secured by the community!

The Kleros Scout Snap utilises information from the following Kleros Curate registries:

* [**Address Tags registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0x66260C69d03837016d88c9877e61e08Ef74C59F2) of verified project and name tag of contracts
* [**Contract-Domain Name registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0x957A53A994860BE4750810131d9c876b2f52d6E1) of verified contract-to-domain name pairings
* [**Tokens registry**](https://curate.kleros.io/tcr/100/0xeE1502e29795Ef6C2D60F8D7120596abE3baD990) of ERC-20 tokens
