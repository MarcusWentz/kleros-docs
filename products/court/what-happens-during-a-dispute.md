# What happens during a dispute?

A dispute goes through several stages after a dispute is created:

1. **Evidence** - Evidence can be submitted. This is also when drawing has to take place.
2. **Commit** - Jurors commit a hashed vote. This is skipped for courts without hidden votes.&#x20;
3. **Vote -** Jurors reveal/cast their vote depending on whether the court has hidden votes or not.&#x20;
4. **Appeal** -  The dispute can be appealed.&#x20;
5. **Execution** - Tokens are redistributed and the ruling is executed.

The period of each stage is different for each (sub)court.
